# Code Conventions

## Formatting

In most cases, Kotlin follows the Java coding conventions.

Use 4 spaces for indentation.
Do not use tabs.

For curly braces, put the opening brace in the end of the line where the construct begins, and the closing brace on a separate line aligned horizontally with the opening construct.
