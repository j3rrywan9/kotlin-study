# Head First Kotlin

## Chapter 1

Kotlin lets you create object-oriented code that uses classes, inheritance and polymorphism, just as you can in Java.
But it also supports functional programming, giving you the best of both worlds.

Kotlin code can be compiled to JVM (Java Virtual Machine) bytecode, so you can use Kotlin practically anywhere that you can use Java.
Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, so you can use existing Java libraries with it.

### Anatomy of the main function

Whenever you write a Kotlin application, you *must* add a function to it called `main`, which starts your application.
When you run your code, the JVM looks for this function, and executes it.

The `fun` keyword is followed by the name of the function, in this case `main`.
Naming the function `main` means that it will be automatically executed when you run the application.

The code in the braces `()` after the function name tells the compiler what arguments (if any) the function takes.
Here, the code `args: Array<String>` specifies that the function accepts an array of `String`s, and this array is named `args`.

From Kotlin 1.3, however, you can omit `main`'s parameters so that the function looks like this:
```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Your code goes here
}
```

### Loop and loop and loop...

### Conditional branching

### Using `if` to return a value

In Kotlin, you can use `if` as an expression, so that it returns a value.
When you use `if` as an expression, you MUST include an `else` clause.

## Chapter 2

### Kotlin's basic types

#### Integers

Kotlin has four basic integer types: `Byte`, `Short`, `Int` and `Long`.
Each type can hold a fixed number of bits.

#### Floating points

There are two basic floating-point types: **Float** and **Double**.
`Float`s can hold 32 bits, whereas `Double`s can hold 64 bits.

#### Booleans

**Boolean** variables are used for values that can either be `true` or `false`.

#### Characters and Strings

There are two more basic types: **Char** and **String**.

### How to explicitly declare a variable's type

Instead of letting the compiler infer the variableâ€™s type from its value, you put a colon (`:`) after the variable's name, followed by the type you want it to be.

### Assigning a value to another variable

### Store multiple values in an array

#### How to create an array

You create an array using the `arrayOf()` function.

You can get the value of an item in the array by referencing the array variable with an index.

### Chapter 3

#### You can get things back from a function

If you want to get something back from a function, you need to declare it.

If you declare that a function returns a value, then you must return a value of the declared type.

##### Functions with no return value

If you don't want your function to return a value, you can either omit the return type from the function declaration, or specify a return type of `Unit`.
Declaring a return type of `Unit` means that the function returns no value.
